In Rust, `with_context` and `expect` are both methods used for error handling, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors:

1. `with_context`:

`with_context` is a method provided by the `anyhow` crate, not a standard Rust feature. It's used to add additional context to an error without changing its type. This method is typically used with the `Result` type.

Key points:
- It allows you to add more information to an error without unwrapping it.
- It returns a new `Result` with the added context.
- If the `Result` is `Ok`, it passes through unchanged.
- It's useful for creating more informative error messages in a chain of operations.

Example:
```rust
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn read_config() -> Result<Config> {
    std::fs::read_to_string("config.toml")
        .with_context(|| "Failed to read config file")?
        .parse()
        .with_context(|| "Failed to parse config file")
}
```

2. `expect`:

`expect` is a method provided by Rust's standard library for both `Option` and `Result` types. It's used to unwrap a value, panicking with a custom message if the value is `None` or `Err`.

Key points:
- It unwraps the value if it's `Some` or `Ok`.
- It panics with a custom error message if it's `None` or `Err`.
- It's typically used when you're certain that a failure shouldn't occur, and if it does, it's a serious enough error to crash the program.

Example:
```rust
let config = std::fs::read_to_string("config.toml")
    .expect("Failed to read config file");
```

Main differences:
- `with_context` adds context without unwrapping, while `expect` unwraps and potentially panics.
- `with_context` is part of the `anyhow` crate, while `expect` is in the standard library.
- `with_context` is used for more graceful error handling, while `expect` is used when you want to crash on unexpected errors.

Would you like me to explain or elaborate on any part of this comparison?
